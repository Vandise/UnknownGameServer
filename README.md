# UnknownGameServer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Vandise/UnknownGameServer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Vandise/UnknownGameServer)

The game server for an unknown multiplayer arcade game. Written with ES6, SocketIO, and RethinkDB to simplify some of the server logic on handling player x-y coordinates and actions.

## Getting Started
Major Dependencies:
* Node >= 5.0
* NPM >= 3.5
* Mocha >= 2.2
* RethinkDB 2.3.1

### Install Dependencies
this might take awhile.
```
npm install
```

### Migrate the Database
This gameserver utilizes rethink DB. You will have to install it via a package manager before running this command:
```
node ./db/migrate -e dev
```

### Run Tests
and watch them pass hopefully.
```
gulp test
```

### Server Environment
The server can be run in three different environments:
* Development (dev)
* Production (prod)
* Test (test)
You can configure some settings in src/conf/[my_env].yml

Each environment can utilize a different database and display different console / log different messages. I suggest you use only the dev and prod options.

You can also pass specific arguments to the game server at runtime:
```
# -e [environment] -p [port number]
node ./dist/server -e dev -p 9000
```

By default
```
npm start
```
Runs the server on port 9090 in the development environment.

## Server Architecture
The server architecture follows a simple but difficult concept to utilize with Node Servers: avoid callbacks when possible. In its most primitive state, the server simply accepts a socket connection, recieves messages with a cookie bound to the socket from the client, and has events bound to a session object containing the socket information in the server. All the actions and events that can be recieved by the socket are contained in the src/app/channels directory. The server itself handles only a connect and disconnect message.

### Channels
Channels are simply all the messages and events a particular socket in the servers session object can receive / listen to.

### Extensions
Extensions are anything that adds functionality to the game server. By itself the game server is simply an object that spins up a server based off of the configuration settings it's passed. Prior to starting up the server, it loads every module in the extensions directory and passes an instance of itself as a parameter. The GameServer object has no knowledge to the functionality of these modules -- making each component of the server as easily testable as web sockets allow you to test. 

#### Input Validation
User input needs to be validated on the client side as well as on the server. Why? Because any individual could open up their developers console within the game, capture the socket connection, read event messages, attempt to emit messages, etc. There will be a handshake between the client and server to validate the socket and the messages it sends. Games are always hackable, it's just my job as a developer to make it as frustrating as possible.

## Contributing
If you wish to contribute, send me an email before sending a pull request or creating an issue. I know the game I want to build and it'll be great for other contributors to understand its goals.

### Tools
There are a couple tools with gulp in place to accelerate development:
```
gulp watch
```
Watches for changes in the src/ directory. It will re-compile the server and run the unit tests.

```
gulp serve
```
Spins up nodemon and runs the server. On each change i.e. with gulp watch, the game server will restart. This is more for testing while developing the client. gulp serve must be run on a separate port from gulp watch due to the watch task running the unit tests (which spins up instances of the server). The gulp file needs some refining once development starts on the client.

#### Migrations
To create the DB structure, manage users, permissions, etc; use migrations. Name the file whatever you like (generally a timestamp or data works to keep the migrations in order) and export a function that accepts three parameters:
- the database driver
- a connection object
- configuration settings for the current environment
